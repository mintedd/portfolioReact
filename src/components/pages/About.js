      Graduated from The Ohio State University. Recieved a Bachelor of Science in Biology Pre-Medicine and Minored in Korean. After graduation, Covid hit and I ended up helping my mother out with her cafe business. However, due to the pandemic we had to shut that down and I went into pursue my career in Real Estate. Loved what I did but wanted a bit more structure to my life so here I am now pursuing Software Engineering
